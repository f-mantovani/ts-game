# TS Game Base

## Introduction

After finishing my bootcamp on Ironhack as a student and got some cohorts as a Teacher Assistant I felt like trying some of the projects again but using TypeScript as a mean to learn a little bit more the different steps on how to do things with that superset of JavaScript

## Usage

- Just fork and clone this project
- Modify as much as you want it

## Contents

The base game already comes with:

- Player moving in all directions
- Obstacles falling down
- Collision detection between the player and the obstacles
- Removal of the obstacles in case of collision
- Pause the game using the `x` key
- Restart when pressing `n` key
